<p>CPCC Cloud Support is an online, chat-based service that our college offers to students. Through CPCC Cloud Support, we can assist you in completing tasks and assignments that involve the use of Microsoft Office. Such products include Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access.  We can also answer questions you may have about our own website: <a href="http://www.cpcc.edu">www.cpcc.edu</a>. Whether it’s registering for classes, using our Student E-mail service, or logging into Blackboard/Moodle – CPCC Cloud Support is here for you.</p>
<p>CPCC Cloud Support can also answer your basic questions about an assignment; unless it is a test, quiz or exam. We are happy to assist you in completing your projects but CPCC Cloud Support is not a tutoring service. If you require tutoring, please contact CPCC’s Academic Learning Center at <a href="tel:+17043306474">704-330-6474</a>.</p>
