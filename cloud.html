<h2>Welcome to CPCC Cloud</h2>
<p>The CPCC Cloud initiative is a pilot project utilizing the latest in technology to provide students with access to CPCC licensed applications on their own personal mobile devices.  The end goal of the CPCC Cloud initiative is to provide students with the both on-campus and off-campus access to CPCC licensed applications.  These applications are critical to enhancing the students learning environment and are provided by Citrix over an Internet connection.  These applications live in a virtual desktop provided by Citrix and are hosted on our own campus servers. Students will need to download and install Citrix on their mobile device supported by our <a href="system-requirments">minimum requirements list.</a> If you have further questions, please look at our <a href="cpcc-cloud-faqs">FAQ page</a>.</p>
<p><i>For the best user experience, ITS recommends downloading and installing the <a href="https://www.citrix.com/go/receiver.html">Citrix Receiver application</a>. </i></p>
