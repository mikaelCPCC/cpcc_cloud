<br><br>
<p>The following instructions will assist you with logging into, setting up, and using your CPCC Cloud virtual environment. You will also learn how to manage your files within the environment.</i>.</p>
<br>
<h2>Using your applications, files, &amp; storage within Citrix Receiver.</h2>
	<p>1. After the installation will be prompted to re-enter your credentials. Re-enter them and click <b>Log On</b>.</p>
	<p><img alt="Re-enter your credentials" class="image-inline" src="../images/firefox/firefox-step-1" width="700" /></p>
	<p>2. You will be taken to a page that displays the available Desktops and Applications that you will have access to.</p>
	<p><img alt="Apps and Desktops" class="image-inline" src="../images/firefox/firefox-step-11" width="700" /></p>
	<p>3. On the bottom of the screen you will see a button that lets you navigate between <b>"Apps</b>" and "<b>Desktops"</b>. Click on "<b>Apps"</b>, and a navigation pane will open on the left. Click on <b><i>"All Apps</i></b>".</p>
	<p><img alt="Select all apps." class="image-inline" src="../images/firefox/firefox-step-12" width="700" /></p>
	<p>4. The All Apps menu will expand and display any apps that you can launch directly from this screen without launching a virtual desktop. Your apps may vary from the screenshot below.</p>
	<p><img alt="Chose an app to launch." class="image-inline" src="../images/firefox/firefox-step-13" /></p>
	<p>5. Click on the <b>"Desktops"</b> button on the bottom of the screen. Select the desktop you would like to use. Citrix will begin to launch the virtual machine.</p>
	<p><img alt="Windows splash screen." class="image-inline" src="../images/firefox/firefox-step-14" width="700" /></p>
	<p>6. The virtual desktop will look and work exactly as a physical desktop. If this is your first time using a virtual environment, we<b> strongly</b> suggest taking the <b>Getting started</b> tour.</p>
	<p><img alt="Take the tour." class="image-inline" src="../images/firefox/firefox-step-15" width="700" /></p>
	<p>7. The virtual desktop will let you open programs as well as search for programs and files. In the below example, Microsoft Word was opened from the start menu.</p>
	<p><img class="image-inline" src="../images/firefox/openingword.png" width="700" /></p>
	<p>8. You can find all of the programs available to you by clicking on the Windows Start Button and selecting the <b>"All Programs"</b> option.</p>
	<p><img class="image-inline" src="../images/receiver/all-programs" /></p>
	<p>9. After clicking <b>"All Programs"</b> you will see a folder named <b>"Microsoft Office 2013"</b>, clicking on this will expand the directory showing you all of the programs that are inside of that folder. In this example, we have chosen to open Word.</p>
	<p><img class="image-inline" src="../images/receiver/opening-office" /></p>
	<p>10. You can also quickly search for a program using the <b>"Search programs and files"</b>. Type in the name of the program, and if it is available a link for it will appear in the upper left navigation menu.</p>
	<p><img class="image-inline" src="../images/receiver/quick-search" /></p>
	<p>11. Click on the link for Word, and Microsoft Word will open.</p>

<h2>How to Save and Access your Files</h2>
	<p>1. When saving files make <b>sure</b> that you are saving any files to your <b>Documents</b> folder. This will <i>usually</i> be your default save location, but <b>double check</b>! <b>Any files not saved to your Documents folder will be lost when you end your session!</b> In this case, click on the "<b>File" </b>link in the ribbon.</p>
	<p><img alt="Saving files." class="image-inline" src="../images/receiver/save-file-1" /></p>
	<p>Select <b>"Save As"</b>.</p>
	<p><img alt="Save file as" class="image-inline" src="../images/receiver/save-as" /></p>
	<p>2. A dialogue box will appear. Make sure that you are saving to <b>your</b> student directory and <b>NOT</b> to your desktop!</p>
	<p><img alt="Save location" class="image-inline" src="../images/receiver/save_dialogue" /></p>
	<p>3. Do not save any files to the Desktop, Download, Recent Places, etc..., folders. If you do not save in the <b>Documents</b> folder, your work <b>will be lost</b>!</p>
	<p><img alt="Double check your save location." class="image-inline" src="../images/firefox/firefox-step-17" width="700" /> <img alt="Do not save to desktop!" class="image-inline" src="../images/firefox/firefox-step-18" /></p>
	<p>4. To access your documents, simply navigate to the start button in the lower left hand corner, open the start menu and select the <b>"Documents"</b> tab. This will open all of your saved files and folders.</p>
	<p><img alt="Access your files and folders." class="image-inline" src="../images/firefox/firefox-step-19" /></p>
	<p>5. A dialogue box will appear. Ensure that you are in your documents folder, and open your saved file.</p>
